# Summary

TODO

# Statement of need

The University of Michigan instance of Software Carpentry has taught workshops
using the curriculum created by the Software Carpentry organization since 2015.
In that time, our instructors have found several advantages and disadvantages to
using the Software Carpentry curriculum.
Some advantages that we found are:
1) it is modular, so workshop organizers can choose any programming language
lesson (e.g. R or Python) to pair with lessons on the unix shell and version
control;
2) it has been refined over years by many contributors and taught at workshops
around the world; and
3) it demonstrates good pedagogy for teaching beginner data science
practitioners.

However, we found that the curriculum did not meet all of our needs.
The disadvantages that we found are:
1) the modular nature of the curriculum means that each lesson is independent
from the others, so it is not apparent to learners how to integrate all of the
skills together for reproducible research projects;
2) there is too much content for the time allotted in a two-day workshop, so
workshops contain inconsistent content depending on who teaches, and new
instructors face an overwhelming amount of work to prepare for their first
workshop; and
3) some lessons include niche content that we do not use ourselves in our
research projects.

We sought to create a new curriculum that would
teach computational skills in an integrated manner to demonstrate the
reproducible research workflows we use in our own work,
utilize the same inclusive pedagogy refined by the Carpentries,
and contain an appropriate amount of content to deliver consistent workshops
and reduce the burden for new instructors to get involved.

# Acknowledgements

We thank the Carpentries organization for their workshop protocols and
open-source Software Carpentry curriculum, upon which this curriculum is based.

We thank Victoria Alden and Scott Martin for assisting us in organizing and
advertising our workshop.
We thank the learners who participated in the workshop.

# Funding

Salary support for PDS came from NIH grant 1R01CA215574.
KLS received support from the NIH Training Program in Bioinformatics (T32
GM070449).
ZL received support from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research
Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE 1256260.
Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this
material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of
the National Science Foundation.

# Author contributions

ZL and KLS contributed equally. ZL is first among the co-first authors because
KLS threatened to reject all pull requests where ZL put KLS first.

PDS supervised the project.
ZL and KLS organized the initial sprint, led the development of the curriculum,
and drafted the manuscript.
ZL, KLS, JK, and ML instructed at the first pilot workshop
while CA, JM, ST, SKL, SJ, and CB assisted learners.
All authors contributed to the development of the curriculum.
