# Summary

# Statement of need

# The Curriculum

# Acknowledgements

We thank the Carpentries organization for their workshop protocols and
open-source Software Carpentry curricula, upon which this curriculum is based.

We thank Victoria Alden and Scott Martin for assisting us in organizing and
advertising our workshop.
We thank the learners who participated in the workshop.

# Funding

# Author contributions

ZL and KLS contributed equally. ZL is first among the co-first authors because
KLS threatened to reject all pull requests where ZL put KLS first.

PDS supervised the project.
ZL and KLS organized the initial sprint, led the development of the curriculum,
and drafted the manuscript.
ZL, KLS, JK, and ML instructed at the first pilot workshop
while CA, JM, ST, SKL, SJ, and CB assisted learners.
All authors contributed to the development of the curriculum.

# Conflicts of interest

None.
