## Introduction to R and RStudio

In this session we will be testing the hypothesis that a country's life expectancy is related to the total value of its finished goods and services, also known as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
To test this hypothesis, we'll need two things: data and a platform to analyze the data.

You already [downloaded the data](setup_instructions). But what platform will we use to analyze the data? We have many options!

TODO: *Add link to information about reprodcible research or leave discussion for later?*

We could try to use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google sheets that have limited access, less flexiblity, and don't easily allow for things that are criticial to "reproducible" research, like easily sharing the steps used to explore and make changes to the original data.

Instead, we'll use the a programming language to test our hypothesis. Today we will use R, but we could have also used Python for the same reasons we chose R (and we teach workshops for both languages). Both R and Python are freely available, the instructions you use to do the analysis are easily shared, and by using reproducible practices, it's straightforward to add more data or to change settings like colors or the size of a plotting symbol.

> ## But why R and not Python?
>>
[There's no great reason](http://www.academichermit.com/2020/03/23/Why-R.html).
>>Although there are subtle differences between the languages, it's ultimately a matter of personal preference. Both are powerful and popular languages that have very well developed and welcoming communities of scientists that use them. As you learn more about R you may find things that are annoying in R that aren't so annoying in Python; the same could be said of learning Python. If the community you work in uses R, then you're in the right place.

To run R, all you really need is the R program, which is available for computers running the Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux operating systems. You downloaded R while getting [set up](setup_instructions) for this workshop.

To make your life in R easier, there is a great (and free!) program called RStudio that you also downloaded and used during [set up](setup_instructions). As we work today, we'll use features that are available in RStudio for writing and running code, managing projects, installing packages, getting help, and much more. It is important to remember that R and RStudio are different, but complementary programs. You need R to use RStudio.

TODO: Change exercise to .md format blocks & add resources to use Rstudio on GreatLakes
> ## Exercise
> **Question:** Can you think of a reason you might not want to use RStudio?
>
> **Answer:** On some high performance computer systems (e.g. Amazon Web Services) you typically can't get a display like RStudio to open. If you're at the University of Michigan and have access to Great Lakes, then you might want to learn more about [resources](broken link) to run RStudio on Great Lakes.

To get started, we'll spend a little time getting familiar with the RStudio environment and setting it up to suit your tastes. When you start RStudio, you'll have three panels.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/initial_rstudio.png)

On the left you'll have a panel with three tabs - Console, Terminal, and Jobs. The Console tab is what running R from the command line looks like. This is where you can enter R code. Try typing in `2+2` at the prompt (>). In the upper right panel are tabs indicating the Environment, History, and a few other things. If you click on the History tab, you'll see the command you ran at the R prompt.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/history.png)

In the lower right panel are tabs for Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer. You used the Packages tab to install tidyverse.

We'll spend more time in each of these tabs as we go through the workshop so we won't spend a lot of time discussing them now.

You might want to alter the appearance of your RStudio window. The default appearance has a white background with black text. If you go to the Tools menu at the top of your screen, you'll see a "Global options" menu at the bottom of the drop down; select that.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/global_options.png)

From there you will see the ability to alter numerous things about RStudio. Under the Appearances tab you can select the theme you like most. As you can see there's a lot in Global options that you can set to improve your experience in RStudio. Most of these settings are a matter of personal preference.

However, you can update settings to help you to insure the reproducibility of your code. In the General tab, none of the selectors in the R Sessions, Workspace, and History should be selected. In additon, the toggle next to "Save workspace to .RData on exit" should be set to never. These setting will help ensure that things you worked on previously don't carry over between sessions.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/general_options.png)

Let's get going on our analysis!

One of the helpful features in RStudio is the ability to create a project. A project is a special directory that contains all of the code and data that you will need to run an analysis.

At the top of your screen you'll see the "File" menu. Select that menu and then the menu for "New Project...".

![](01-r-plotting-assets/new_project_menu.png)

When the smaller window opens, select "Existing Directory" and then the "Browse" button in the next window.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/existing_directory.png)
![](01-r-plotting-assets/browse.png)

Navigate to the directory that contains your code and data from the setup instructions and click the "Open" button.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/navigate_to_project.png)

Then click the "Create Project" button.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/create_project.png)

Did you notice anything change?

In the lower right corner of your RStudio session, you should notice that your Files tab is now your project directory. You'll also see a file called my_project.Rproj in that directory.

From now on, you should start RStudio by double clicking on that file. This will make sure you are in the correct directory when you run your analysis.

![](01-r-plotting-assets/files_with_rproj.png)

We'd like to create a file where we can keep track of our R code.

Back in the "File" menu, you'll see the first option is "New File". Selecting "New File" opens another menu to the right and the first option is "R Script". Select "R Script".

TODO: *Confirm paths with larger group/unix group*
Now we have a fourth panel in the upper left corner of RStudio that includes an **Editor** tab with an untitled R Script. Let's save this file as `gdp_population.R` in our project directory.

We will be entering R code into the **Editor** tab to run in our **Console** panel.

On line 1 of `gdp_population.R`, type `2+2`.

With your cursor on the line with the `2+2`, click the button that says "Run". You should be able to see that `2+2` was run in the Console.

As you write more code, you can highlight multiple lines and then click "Run" to run all of the lines you have selected.

Let's delete the line with 2+2 and replace it with `library(tidyverse)`.

Go ahead and run that line in the **Console** by clicking the <kbd>Run</kbd> button on the top right of the **Editor** tab and choosing <kbd>Run Selected Lines</kbd>

## Hint / Pro-tip
Those of us that use R on a daily basis use cheat sheets to help us remember how to use various R functions. If you haven't already, print out the PDF versions of the cheat sheets that were in the setup instructions.

You can also find them in RStudio by going to the "Help" menu and selecting "Cheat Sheets". The two that will be most helpful in this workshop are "Data Visualization with ggplot2" and "Data Transformation with dplyr".

# Loading and reviewing data

We will import a subset file from the gapminder dataset called `gapminder_1997.csv`. There are many ways to import data into R but for your first plot we will use RStudio's file menu to import and display this data. As we move through this process, RStudio will translate these *point and click* commands into code for us.

In RStudio select "File" > "Import Dataset" > "From Text (readr)".

TODO: *Update '<<data directory>> to match the directory structure from setup*
The file is located in the directory <<data directory>>, click the "browse" button and select the file named `gapminder_1997.csv`. A preview of the data will appear in the window. You can see there are a lot of Import Options listed, but R has chosen the correct defaults for this particular file.

We can see in that box that our data will be imported with the Name: "gapminder_1997". Also note that this screen will show you all the code that will be run when you import your data in the lower right "Code Preview". Since everything looks good, click the "Import" button to bring your data into R.

After you've imported your data, you will a table open in a new tab in the top left corner of RStudio. This is a quick way to browse your data to make sure everything looks like it has been imported correctly. To review the data, click on the new tab.

We see that our data has 5 columns (variables).

Each row contains life expectancy ("lifeExp"), the total population ("pop"), and the per capita gross domestic product ("gdpPercap") for a given country ("country").

There is also a column that says which continent each country is in ("continent"). Note that both North America and South America are combined into one category called "Americas".

After we've reviewed the data, you'll want to make sure to click the tab in the upper left to return to your `gdp_population.R` file so we can start writing some code.

Now look in the **Environment** tab in the upper right corner of RStudio. Here you will see a list of all the objects you've created or imported during your R session. You will now see `gapminder_1997` listed here as well.

Finally, take a look at the **Console** at the bottom left part of the RStudio screen. Here you will see the commands that were run for you to import your data in addition to associated metadata and warnings.

# Understanding commands

Let's start by looking at the code RStudio ran for us by copying and pasting the first line from the console into our `gdp_population.R` file that is open in the **Editor** window.

TODO: *Confirm that this is the example output*
```
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv(file = "SoftwareCarpentry/SoftwareCarpentry09_05/myData/gapminder_data.csv")

```

You should now have a line of text in your code file that started with `gapminder` and ends with a `)` symbol.

What if we want to run this command from our code file?

In order to run code that you've typed in the editor, you have a few options. We can click <kbd>Run</kbd> again from the right side of the **Editor** tab but the quickest way to run the code is by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard.

This will run the line of code that currently contains your cursor and will move your cursor to the next line. Note that when Rstudio runs your code, it basically just copies your code from the **Editor** window to the **Console** window, just like what happened when we selected <kbd>Run Selected Line(s)</kbd>.

Let's take a closer look at the parts of this command.

Starting from the left, the first thing we see is `gapminder_1997`. We viewed the contents of this file after it was imported so we know that `gapminder_1997` acts as a placeholder for a table of data.

TODO: *Create exercise here*
> # Running parts of our code
> If we highlight just `gapminder_1997` within our code file and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on our keyboard, what do we see?
>> Solution: we see an output with a similar format to what we saw in the Viewer tab

TODO: *Clarify/correct wording here*
In R terms, `gapminder_1997` is a named **object** that references or stores something, in this case that's a specific table of data.

TODO: *Update to be a collapsable option & determine how exhaustive to be*
> # Guidelines on naming objects:
>> - You want your object names to be explicit and not too long.
>> - They cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is).
>> - R is case sensitive, so for example, weight_kg is different from Weight_kg.
>> - There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for, see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use.
>> - It's best to avoid dots (.) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages.
>> - It is recommended to use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.
>> - Be consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. One popular style guide can be found through the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

Looking back at the command in our code file, the second thing we see if a `<-` symbol, which is the **assignment operator**. It assigns values generated or typed on the right to objects on the left. An alternative symbol that you might see used as an **assignment operator** is the `=` but it is clearer to only use `<-` for assignment. We use this symbol so often that RStudio has a keyboard short cut for it: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Windows, and <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Mac.

The next part of the command is `read_csv(file = "SoftwareCarpentry/SoftwareCarpentry09_05/myData/gapminder_data.csv")`. This has a few different key parts. The first part `

You call a function in R by typing it's name followed by opening then closing parenthesis.  Let's try to run the function without anything inside the parenthesis.

~~~
read_csv()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in read_delimited(file, tokenizer, col_names = col_names, col_types = col_types, : argument "file" is missing, with no default
~~~
{: .error}

We get an error message!
```
Error in read_delimited(file, tokenizer, col_names = col_names, col_types = col_types,  :
  argument "file" is missing, with no default
```
{ .error: error messages.}


Some functions like `read_csv` require additional pieces of information in order to do their job, we call these additional values "arguments" or "parameters."

You pass **arguments** to a function by placing values in between the parenthesis. Argument names precede their values but most are optional if you pass them in a certain order.

When you need to pass in multiple arguments to a function you will separate those values with commas. But that's just a quick summary -- we will see examples of those later.

Each function has a help page that documents what arguments the function expects and what value it will return. You can bring up the help page a few different ways. If you have typed the function name in the **Editor** windows, you can put your cursor on the function name and press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open help page in the **Help** viewer in the lower right corner of RStudio. You can also type `?` followed by the function name in the console. For example `?read_csv`. The help pages often have useful examples of the function in action.

- Touch on data types (will go into more detail later??) TODO: *Touch on data types? Determine about of detail to include for types of data in R at this stage*

# Creating our first plot

We will be using the `ggplot2` package today to make our plots. This is a very powerful package that creates professional looking plots and is one of the reasons people like using R so much. All plots made using the `ggplot2` package start by calling the `ggplot()` function. So in the tab you created for the `gdp_population.R` file, type the following:

~~~
ggplot(data=gapminder_1997)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in ggplot(data = gapminder_1997): object 'gapminder_1997' not found
~~~
{: .error}
In order to run code that you've typed in the editor, you have a few options. Remember that the quickest way to run the code is by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard. This will run the line of code that currently contains your cursor or any highlighted code.

When we run this code, the **Plots** tab will pop to the front in the lower right corner of the RStudio screen. Right now, we just see a big grey rectangle.

What we've done is created a ggplot object and told it we will be using the data from the `gapminder_1997` object that we've loaded into R. We've done this by calling the `ggplot()` function with `gapminder_1997` as the `data=` argument.

So we've made a plot object, now we need to start telling it what we actually want to draw in this plot. With ggplot, we start connecting our data to different plot elements by creating an "aesthetic mapping", which we do with the `aes()` function.

The elements of a plot have a bunch of properties like an x and y position, a color, a size, etc and we need to match those up to values inside our `gapminder_1997` object. When we pass our data values to the `aes()` function, we do so as if the column names of our data object are variables that exist in R. This means that what we type much match the comlumn names exactly (upper and lowercase).

The plot object will look those values up in the data object that we supplied so we can start by telling our plot object that we want to map our GDP values to the x axis of our plot. We do this by adding (`+`) information to our plot object. Add this new line to your code and run both lines by highlighting them and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard:

~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in ggplot(data = gapminder_1997): object 'gapminder_1997' not found
~~~
{: .error}
Note that we've added this new function call to a second line just to make it easier to read. To do this we make sure that the `+` is at the end of the first line otherwise R will assume your command ends when it starts the next row. The `+` sign indicates not only that we are adding information, but that there is more to come.

Observe that our **Plot** window is no longer a grey square. We now see that we've mapped the `gdpPercap` column to the x axis of our plot. Note that that column name isn't very pretty as a label, so let's use the `labs()` function to make a nicer label for the x axis


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in ggplot(data = gapminder_1997): object 'gapminder_1997' not found
~~~
{: .error}

OK. That looks better. Notice that when we added the label value we did so by placing the values inside quotes. This is because we are not using a value from inside our data object and we are providing the name directly. When you need to include actual text values in R, they will be placed inside quotes to tell them apart from other object names.

Let's now map our `lifeExp` values to the y axis and give them a nice label.


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita") +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  labs(y = "Life Expectancy")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in ggplot(data = gapminder_1997): object 'gapminder_1997' not found
~~~
{: .error}

Excellent. We've now told our plot object where the x and y values are coming from and what they stand for. But we haven't told our object how we want it to draw the data. There are many different plot types (bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, etc). We tell our plot object what to draw by adding a "geometry" ("geom" for short) to our object. We will talk about many different geometries today, but for our first plot, let's draw our data using points for each value in the data set. So we will add `geom_point()` to our plot object


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita") +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  labs(y = "Life Expectancy") +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in ggplot(data = gapminder_1997): object 'gapminder_1997' not found
~~~
{: .error}

Now we're really getting somewhere. It finally looks like a proper plot!  We can now see a trend in the data. It looks like countries with a larger GDP tend to have a higher life expectancy. Let's add a title to our plot to make that more clear. Again, we will use the `labs()` function, but this time we will get the `title=` argument.


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita") +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  labs(y = "Life Expectancy") +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title= "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?")
~~~
{: .language-r}

Error in ggplot(data = gapminder_1997): object 'gapminder_1997' not found

{: .error}

No one can deny we've made a very handsome plot. But now looking at the data, we might be curious about learning more about the points that are the extremes of the data. We know that we have two more pieces of data that we've imported that we haven't used yet. Maybe we are curious if there are any different patterns for the different continents. One thing we could do is use a different color for each of the continents. To map the color of each point to a continent, we will again use the `aes()` function


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita") +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  labs(y = "Life Expectancy") +

  aes(color=continent)

Here we can see that in 1997 the African countries had much lower life expectancy values than many of the other groups. Notice that when we adding a mapping for color, ggplot automatically provided a legend for us. It took care of assigning different colors to each of our unique values of continent. (Note that when we mapped the x and y values, those drew the actual axis labels, so in a way the axes are like the legends for the x and y values). The colors that ggplot uses are determined by the color "scale". Each aesthetic value we can supply (x, y, color, etc) has a corresponding scale. Let's change the colors to make them a bit pritter


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita") +
  aes(y = lifeExp) +
  labs(y = "Life Expectancy") +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?") +
  aes(color = continent) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
~~~

~~~
Error in ggplot(data = gapminder_1997): object 'gapminder_1997' not found

The `scale_color_brewer()` function is just one of many you can use to change colors. There are bunch of "palettes" that are build in. You can view them all by running `RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()` or check out the [Color Brewer website](https://colorbrewer2.org/) for more info about choosing plot colors.

Since we have the data for population, we might be curious what effect the population of a country might have on the life expectancy and the GDP per capita. Do you think larger countires will have a longer or shorter life expectancy? Let's find out by mapping the size of our points to the population values in our data


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita") +

There doesn't seem to be a very strong association with population size. We can see two very large countries with relatively low GDP per capita (but since the per capita value is already dividied by the total population, there is some problems with separating those two values). We got another legend here for size which is nice, but the values look a bit ugly in scientific notation. Let's divide all the values by 1,000,000 and label our legend "Population (in millions)"

This works because you can treat the columns in the aesthetic mappings just like any other variables and can use functions to transform or change them at plot time rather than having to transform your data first.

Good work. Take a moment to appreciate what a cool plot you made with a few lines of code. We added each line one at a time so you could see the effect that it had on the output. But note, you can actually combine many of these steps if you like so you don't have to type as much. For example, you can collect all the `aes()` statements and all the `labs()` together. A more condensed version of the exact same plot would look like this

ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop/1000000) +

  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy",
    title= "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?", size="Population (in millions)")

# Plotting for data exploration

Many datasets are much more complex than the example we used for the first plot. How can we find meaningful patterns in complex data and create visualizations to convey those patterns?

## Importing datasets

In the first plot, we looked at a smaller slice of a large dataset. To gain a better understanding of the kinds of patterns we might observe in our own data, we will now used the full dataset, which is stored in a called "gapminder_data.csv".

To start, we will read in the data without using the interactive RStudio file navigation.

~~~
gapminder_data <- read_csv() # what argument (including file path) should be provided here to read in the full dataset?
~~~
{: .language-r}

Let's take a look at the full dataset.

~~~
dim(gapminder_data) # how can we find out what the data's _dim_ensions are?
head(gapminder_data) # how can we look at a snapshot of the data via the command line?
~~~
{: .language-r}
Why not use View() like we did for the smaller dataset? You can but if a data frame is too big, might take too long too long to load, so easier to look at part of it.

Notice that this table has an additional column `Year` compared to the smaller dataset we started with.

Now that we have the full dataset read into our R session, let's plot the data. Notice that we've collapsed the plotting function options and left off some of the labels so there's not as much to work with. Here's our code

~~~
  ggplot(data = gapminder_data) +
  aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, color=continent) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}
Hm, this isn't a very clear plot. What's going on?

Since the dataset is more complex, the plotting options we used for the smaller dataset aren't as useful for interpreting these data. Luckily, we can add additional attributes to our plots that will make patterns more apparant. For example, we can generate a different type of plot, a line plot, and assign attributes for columns where we might expect to see patterns.

Let's review the columns and the type of data stored in the full table to decide how we should group things together.

~~~
str(gapminder_data) # a quick way to get an overview of the data
~~~
{: .language-r}

So, what do we see? The column names are listed after a `$` symbol, and then we have a `:` followed by a text label. These labels correspond to the type of data stored in each column.

What kind of data do we see?
* "int"= Integer (or whole number)
* "num" = Numeric (or non-whole number)
* "Factor" = [special data object](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_factors.htm) that are used to store categorical data and have limited numbers of unique values

We can look at columns that store factors in more detail.

Our plot has a lot of points in columns which makes it hard to see trends over time. A better way to view the data showing changes over time is to use a [line plot](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-line-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization).
