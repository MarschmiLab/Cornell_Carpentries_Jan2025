# Introduction to R and RStudio
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Over this workshop, we will be testing the hypothesis that a country's life expectancy is related to the total value of its finished goods and services, also known as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
To test this hypothesis, we'll need two things: data and a platform to analyze the data.

You already [downloaded the data]({{ page.root }}/setup.html). But what platform will we use to analyze the data? We have many options!

We could try to use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google sheets that have limited access, less flexibility, and don't easily allow for things that are critical to ["reproducible" research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285), like easily sharing the steps used to explore and make changes to the original data.

Instead, we'll use a programming language to test our hypothesis. Today we will use R, but we could have also used Python for the same reasons we chose R (and we teach workshops for both languages). Both R and Python are freely available, the instructions you use to do the analysis are easily shared, and by using reproducible practices, it's straightforward to add more data or to change settings like colors or the size of a plotting symbol.

> ## But why R and not Python?
> [There's no great reason](http://www.academichermit.com/2020/03/23/Why-R.html).
> Although there are subtle differences between the languages, it's ultimately a matter of personal preference. Both are powerful and popular languages that have very well developed and welcoming communities of scientists that use them. As you learn more about R, you may find things that are annoying in R that aren't so annoying in Python; the same could be said of learning Python. If the community you work in uses R, then you're in the right place.

To run R, all you really need is the R program, which is available for computers running the Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux operating systems. You downloaded R while getting [set up]({{ page.root }}/setup.html) for this workshop.

To make your life in R easier, there is a great (and free!) program called RStudio that you also downloaded and used during [set up]({{ page.root }}/setup.html). As we work today, we'll use features that are available in RStudio for writing and running code, managing projects, installing packages, getting help, and much more. It is important to remember that R and RStudio are different, but complementary programs. You need R to use RStudio.

> Bonus Exercise: Can you think of a reason you might not want to use RStudio?

> > ## Solution:
> > On some high-performance computer systems (e.g. Amazon Web Services) you typically can't get a display like RStudio to open. If you're at the University of Michigan and have access to Great Lakes, then you might want to learn more about [resources](https://arc-ts.umich.edu/greatlakes/user-guide/#document-3) to run RStudio on Great Lakes.

{: .challenge}

To get started, we'll spend a little time getting familiar with the RStudio environment and setting it up to suit your tastes. When you start RStudio, you'll have three panels.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/initial_rstudio.png" width="700"/>

On the left you'll have a panel with three tabs - Console, Terminal, and Jobs. The Console tab is what running R from the command line looks like. This is where you can enter R code. Try typing in `2+2` at the prompt (>). In the upper right panel are tabs indicating the Environment, History, and a few other things. If you click on the History tab, you'll see the command you ran at the R prompt.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/history.png" width="700"/>

In the lower right panel are tabs for Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer. You used the Packages tab to install tidyverse.

We'll spend more time in each of these tabs as we go through the workshop, so we won't spend a lot of time discussing them now.

You might want to alter the appearance of your RStudio window. The default appearance has a white background with black text. If you go to the Tools menu at the top of your screen, you'll see a "Global options" menu at the bottom of the drop down; select that.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/global_options.png" width="600"/>

From there you will see the ability to alter numerous things about RStudio. Under the Appearances tab you can select the theme you like most. As you can see there's a lot in Global options that you can set to improve your experience in RStudio. Most of these settings are a matter of personal preference.

However, you can update settings to help you to insure the reproducibility of your code. In the General tab, none of the selectors in the R Sessions, Workspace, and History should be selected. In addition, the toggle next to "Save workspace to .RData on exit" should be set to never. These setting will help ensure that things you worked on previously don't carry over between sessions.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/general_options.png" width="600"/>

Let's get going on our analysis!

One of the helpful features in RStudio is the ability to create a project. A project is a special directory that contains all of the code and data that you will need to run an analysis.

At the top of your screen you'll see the "File" menu. Select that menu and then the menu for "New Project...".

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/new_project_menu.png" width="600"/>

When the smaller window opens, select "Existing Directory" and then the "Browse" button in the next window.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/existing_directory.png" width="600"/>

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/browse.png" width="600"/>

Navigate to the directory that contains your code and data from the setup instructions and click the "Open" button.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/navigate_to_project.png" width="600"/>

Then click the "Create Project" button.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/create_project.png" width="600"/>

Did you notice anything change?

In the lower right corner of your RStudio session, you should notice that your
Files tab is now your project directory. You'll also see a file called
un-report.Rproj in that directory.

From now on, you should start RStudio by double clicking on that file. This will
make sure you are in the correct directory when you run your analysis.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/files_with_rproj.png" width="600"/>

We'd like to create a file where we can keep track of our R code.

Back in the "File" menu, you'll see the first option is "New File". Selecting "New File" opens another menu to the right and the first option is "R Script". Select "R Script".

Now we have a fourth panel in the upper left corner of RStudio that includes an **Editor** tab with an untitled R Script. Let's save this file as `base_R.R` in our project directory.

We will be entering R code into the **Editor** tab to run in our **Console** panel.

On line 1 of `base_R.R`, type `2+2`.

With your cursor on the line with the `2+2`, click the button that says <kbd>Run</kbd>. You should be able to see that `2+2` was run in the Console.

As you write more code, you can highlight multiple lines and then click <kbd>Run</kbd> to run all of the lines you have selected.

# Objects and Assignment
_[Back to top](#contents)_

When we're coding in R, we often want to assign a value, or a collection of values, to an **object**, which means we gave those values a name. To create an object in R, we'll use the `<-` symbol, which is the **assignment operator**. It assigns values generated or typed on the right to objects on the left. 

```{r assignment}
number_1 <- 2

number_2 <- 3

my_field <- "Microbiology"
```

Now we can see our obejcts in the Environment pane. An alternative symbol that you might see used as an **assignment operator** is the `=` but it is clearer to only use `<-` for assignment. We use this symbol so often that RStudio has a keyboard short cut for it: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Windows, and <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Mac. You can retrieve the values you stored by typing the name of the object. 

```{r using an object)}
number_1

number_1 + number_2

my_field
```

> ## Assigning values to objects
> Try to assign values to some objects and observe each object after you have assigned a new value. What do you notice?
>
> ```{r Objects, eval = FALSE}
> name <- "Ben"
> name
> age <- 26
> age
> name <- "Harry Potter"
> name
> ```
> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> > When we assign a value to an object, the object stores that value so we can access it later. However, if we store a new value in an object we have already created (like when we stored "Harry Potter" in the `name` object), it replaces the old value. The `age` object does not change, because we never assign it a new value.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


> ## Guidelines on naming objects
> - You want your object names to be explicit and not too long.
> - They cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is).
> - R is case sensitive, so for example, weight_kg is different from Weight_kg.
> - You cannot use spaces in the name.
> - There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for; see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use (`?function_name`).
> - It's best to avoid dots (.) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages.
> - It is recommended to use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.
> - Be consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. One popular style guide can be found through the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
{: .checklist}

> ## Bonus Exercise: Bad names for objects
> Try to assign values to some new objects. What do you notice? After running all four lines of code bellow, what value do you think the object `Flower` holds?
>
> ```{r BadObjects, eval = FALSE}
> 1number <- 3
> Flower <- "marigold"
> flower <- "rose"
> favorite number <- 12
> ```
> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> > Notice that we get an error when we try to assign values to `1number` and `favorite number`. This is because we cannot start an object name with a numeral and we cannot have spaces in object names. The object `Flower` still holds "marigold." This is because R is case-sensitive, so running `flower <- "rose"` does NOT change the `Flower` object. This can get confusing, and is why we generally avoid having objects with the same name and different capitalization.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

If we want to store a collection of values, we'll need to use the `c()` (for "combine") function, which combines values into something we call a **vector**. Let's make a vector of numbers, and a vector of words (we call them "strings" in R)

```{r making a vector}
my_num_vec <- c(1, 2, 3)

my_num_vec

my_name_vec <- c("Dog", "Cat", "Bird")

my_name_vec

```

In R, functions will have a name (in this case, `c`), and then parentheses. Inside the parentheses are our **arguments**.

We can also add vectors together.

```{r adding vectors}
my_num_vec2 <- c(2,4,6)

my_num_vec + my_num_vec2

my_num_vec + my_name_vec
```
Oh no! We got an error from that last line of code. Don't panic - errors are normal and are meant to help us. In order to understand this error, we need to discuss **data types**.

# Data Types
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Every value in R has a *type*. We can ask what the datatype of an object is using another function, `typeof()`.

```{r data types}
typeof(my_num_vec)

typeof(my_name_vec)
```
Our vector of numbers is the type `double`, which you'll also see written as `numeric`. The data type of our name vector is `character`. There are five main data types in R: `double`, `integer`, `complex`, `logical`, and `character`. Today, we're only going to worry about double (numeric), character, and logical types. Logical types represent `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

```{r logical type}
my_logic_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

typeof(my_logic_vec)
```
> ## Pro-tip
> 
> We don't need to write out the full word `TRUE` or `FALSE`; we can also use `T` 
> or `F`. R will not accept `true` or `t`. I like writing out the full word to 
> make my code as clear as possible.
>
{: .callout}

The data type of a vector determines what sort of functions we can use it in. For example, we can add two numerical vectors together, but we cannot add a character vector to a numeric vector. R is strict about these rules, and will give us errors if we try. Let's see our last error again:

```{r non-numeric error}
my_num_vec + my_name_vec
```
R is telling us it cannot add these vectors together, because we gave it a non-numeric (character) argument.

# Data Structures
_[Back to top](#contents)_

The way we organize pieces of data in R is called a **data structure**. Luckily, we've already learned about one data structure - the vector! A vector is an organized list of values *which have the same data type*. What happens if we try to make a vector with a combination of data types?

```{r multi-type vector}
mixed_vector <- c(2, TRUE, "Word")

mixed_vector

typeof(mixed_vector)
```
All of the values in our `mixed_vector` have become characters. We can spot characters because they have "" around them. Converting between types is called **coercion** in R. `Character` is the most general data type, because while any number or logical value can be represented as a word, most words cannot be represented as numbers. We can coerce objects to different types, using functions that start with `as.` However, if R cannot figure out how to convert a value, it will return `NA` instead, and give you a warning.

```{r using as.}
as.character(my_num_vec)

as.numeric(my_logic_vec)

as.numeric(my_name_vec)

```

What if we want an object in R that can hold multiple different types of data? For this, we have a specialized data structure in R, called a `list`. While we make vectors using the `c()` function, we make lists using the `list()` function. 

```{r lists}
my_list <- list(2, c(TRUE,FALSE), "Word")

my_list
```

If we click on `my_list` in the environment pane, we can see what values it stores. Notice that none of the values underwent coercion, unlike in our vector. Lists can hold anything, including vectors and even other lists.

While vectors and lists are important data structures, as microbiologists, most of the time we work with **tabular data**. In R, tabular data is represented by a structure called a `data.frame`. Like lists, `data.frames` can hold multiple data types. We can make a `data.frame` from scratch using the `data.frame()` function.

```{r dataframe}
micro_df <- data.frame(species = c("Ecoli", "Bsubtilis", "Saureus"),
                       gram_pos = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE),
                       genome_mbp = c(5, 4.2, 2.8))

micro_df
```

`Data.frames` are organized by columns (`variables`) and rows (`observations`). To view `data.frames`, we can print them in the console by typing their name, or clicking on them in the `Environment` pane. `Data.frames` come with some rules:

 1. Every column needs to have the same number of rows
 2. Each column is a single data type
 3. Column names should be valid object names in R, so avoid spaces, special characters, and starting with numbers (there are workarounds but we should avoid them). 
 
# Subsetting Data
_[Back to top](#contents)_
 
Often, we want to access specific values from data structure in R. There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

Let's start with vectors.

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
x
```

> ## Atomic vectors
> 
> In R, simple vectors containing character strings, numbers, or logical values are called *atomic* vectors because they can't be further simplified.
>
{: .callout}

## Accessing elements using their indices
_[Back to top](#contents)_

To extract elements of a vector we can use square brackets `[]` and give their corresponding index, starting
from one:

```{r}
x[1]
```

```{r}
x[4]
```

It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. For vectors
(and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

We can ask for multiple elements at once, by putting a vector in the brackets:

```{r}
x[c(1, 3)]
```

Or slices of the vector:

```{r}
x[1:4]
```

the `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right.

```{r}
1:4
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

We can ask for the same element multiple times:

```{r}
x[c(1,1,3)]
```

If we ask for an index beyond the length of the vector, R will return a missing value:

```{r}
x[6]
```

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:

```{r}
x[0]
```


> ## Vector numbering in R starts at 1
> In many programming languages (C and Python, for example), the first
element of a vector has an index of 0. In R, the first element is 1.
>
{: .callout}


## Skipping and removing elements
_[Back to top](#contents)_

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return every element *except* for the one specified:

```{r}
x[-2]
```

We can skip multiple elements:

```{r}
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
```

To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the result back into the variable:

```{r}
x <- x[-4]
x
```

> ## Bonus Exercise: Subsetting by Number
> Given the following code:
> ```{r}
> x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
> print(x)
> ```
> Come up with at least 2 different commands that will produce the following output:

> x[2:4]

> > x[2:4]
> > x[-c(1,5)]
> > x[c(2,3,4)]
> > ```
> > 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Subsetting by name
_[Back to top](#contents)_

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of extracting by index. To do so, we first need to give our vector `names`

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)

names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

x[c("a", "c")]
```

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the position of various elements can often change when chaining together subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

## Subsetting through logical operations
_[Back to top](#contents)_

We can also use any logical vector to subset:

```{r}
x[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

Usually, we don't want to type out all the `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s. Instead, we want to find data that match a specific condition. To do so, we use **logical operators**. We use these functions to compare values in R, and they return a logical value. Some common logical operators include `==` ("is equal to"), `!=` ("is not equal to"), `>`/`<` ("is greater than/is lesser than"), and `>=`/`<=` ("is greater or equal to/is lesser or equal to").

```{r}
"A" == "B"

"b" != "A"

3 > 2

3 <= 2
```

We can use a logical operator on a vector, which produces a logical vector.

```{r}
x

x > 5
```

As such, we can use the results of a logical comparison to subset a vector.

```{r}
x[x > 7]
```

Breaking it down, this statement first evaluates `x>7`, generating a logical vector `c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`, and then selects the elements of `x` corresponding to the `TRUE` values.

We can use `==` to mimic the previous method of indexing by name (remember you have to use `==` rather than `=` for comparisons):

```{r}
x[names(x) == "a"]
```

## Subsetting Lists
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Now we'll introduce some new subsetting operators. There are three functions used to subset lists. We've already seen one of these when learning about atomic vectors (`[`), and we'll learn two more, (`[[`), and (`$`).

Using `[` will always return a list. We can check the data *structure* of an object using the `class()` function. If you want to *subset* a list, but not *extract* an element, then you will likely use `[`.

```{r}
my_list

class(my_list)

my_list[1]

class(my_list[1])
```

This returns a *list with one element*.

To extract individual elements of a list, you need to use the double-square bracket function: `[[`.

```{r}
my_list[[2]]

class(my_list[[2]])
```

Notice that now the result is a vector, not a list.

You can't extract more than one element at once:

```{r, error=TRUE}
my_list[[1:2]]
```

Nor use it to skip elements:

```{r, error=TRUE}
my_list[[-1]]
```

We can also extract using names. We'll first need to add names to our list. 

```{r}
names(my_list)

names(my_list) <- c("a","b","c")

my_list
```
Now, let's extract using the name of the first object:

```{r}
my_list[["a"]]
```

The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:

```{r}
my_list$b
```

## Subsetting Data Frames
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Similar rules apply for data frames as with lists. However they are also two dimensional objects, so there are some differences.

`[` with one argument will act the same way as for lists, where each list element corresponds to a column. The resulting object will be a data frame:

```{r}
micro_df

micro_df[1]
```

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column* as a vector:

```{r}
micro_df[[1]]
```

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:

```{r}
micro_df$species
```

We can also index by both rows **and** columns. We'll use the `[` function, but instead provide 2 arguments, separated by a comma. The first will specify rows, and the second will specify columns. For example:

```{r}
# Pull out the first row
micro_df[1,]

# Pull out the second column
micro_df[,2]

# Pull out object at row 1, column two
micro_df[1,2]
```

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because the elements are mixed types). 

But for a single column the result will be a vector.
