# Departing on your own coding journey

In this workshop, you learned some basic procedures for importing, processing and managing your data, as well as visualizing your results. Moving forward, 

* you are bound to encounter bugs and will figure out how to solve them (debugging)
* you will probably want to apply some specific analysis technique and will need to figure out how to do that (learning).

In this part of the course, our goal is  to provide you with some useful tips and tricks on how to keep growing on your programming journey.

## How to debug your code
Even well seasoned coders run into bugs all the time throughout their coding adventures. Here is a suggested flow for working through an error:

1. Don't panic. Bugs are a normal part of the coding process. Think of each bug as a great opportunity for becoming a better programmer.
2. Read the error message that R issues and see if that helps you figure out the problem. The error message may give you a hint which line in your code, i.e., function call, is failing.
3. Make sure your code syntax is correct. For example, are all the braces and brackets properly closed?
4. Google the error message along with the function that is not working. Most likely, someone encountered this error before you  and the examples online will help you figure out your own issue.
5. Ask for help. If you are certain that your issue cannot be solved with existing online documentation, take your problem to a user forum. Typically, users provide a piece of sample data along with the function call and error message  to request feedback from other users.
